Buffer vs Scanner? IEK 

Some guys answer from Stack overflow that i linked in the code.

"BufferedReader has significantly larger buffer memory than Scanner. 

Use BufferedReader if you want to get long strings from a stream, and use Scanner if you want to parse specific type of token from a stream.
Scanner can use tokenize using custom delimiter and parse the stream into primitive types of data, while BufferedReader can only read and store String.
BufferedReader is synchronous while Scanner is not. 

Use BufferedReader if you're working with multiple threads.
Scanner hides IOException while BufferedReader throws it immediately." 

Another useful one:

"
BufferedReader only read data but scanner also parse data.
you can only read String using BufferedReader, but you can read int, long or float using Scanner.
BufferedReader is older from Scanner,it exists from jdk 1.1 while Scanner was added on JDK 5 release.
The Buffer size of BufferedReader is large(8KB) as compared to 1KB of Scanner.
BufferedReader is more suitable for reading file with long String while Scanner is more suitable for reading small user input from command prompt.
BufferedReader is synchronized but Scanner is not, which means you cannot share Scanner among multiple threads.
BufferedReader is faster than Scanner because it doesn't spent time on parsing
BufferedReader is a bit faster as compared to Scanner
BufferedReader is from java.io package and Scanner is from java.util package on basis of the points we can select our choice.
